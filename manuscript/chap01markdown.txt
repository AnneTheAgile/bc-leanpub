# Chapter 1. Markdown flavors and Automation.

## Markdown at LeanPub.

It appears LeanPub uses a slightly non-standard markdown. I do not recall the original DaringFireball having its prefix items.

- Does it have G for generic box?
- Does it have Curly code? 

Here we will show a code block, aka  a recipe. and it has an id.

{#ch01-ex12-ruby-init}

{title="Example 12: Creating a class in Ruby", lang=ruby, linenos=off}
~~~~~~~
class Book
  def initialize(title)
    @title = title 
  end 
end
~~~~~~~

OK, also let's ensure we can link to something. Is this live?  http://leanpub.com
Or does it need to be on its own line to be live? 
http://leanpub.com

Or perhaps it needs non-standard brackets, ie no html a-ref. <http://leanpub.com>

Make this monospace; `We will see.`
OK that's enough.
