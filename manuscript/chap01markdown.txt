# Chapter 1. Markdown flavors and Automation; Curly-Pound-Label. {#link1-chap1hdr}

## Markdown at LeanPub. Level 2 header.

// MAKE ref to Non-Test => Curly + id= + Quoted-LABEL
//where Named title is Bang-SquareTitle-RoundPath
{id="cat-picture"}
![A picture of a cat](images/cat.jpg)
OR 
//code block 
{id='something-amazing',line-numbers=off,lang=ruby}
~~~~~~
def  mycode here end
~~~~~~


It appears LeanPub uses a slightly non-standard markdown. I do not recall the original DaringFireball having its prefix items.
- Does it have G for generic box?
- Does it have Curly code? 

1.Make a Reference;  put the special curly-pound-label **before** the sentence of interest, on its own line

{#link3-foo-mytitle}
 this link3-foo-mytitle above , where Caret is required and Foo is a unique value BUT periods are Barred; 


Here we will show a code block, aka  a recipe. and it has an id.

{id='link2-ch01-ruby-code', line-numbers=on, title="Example 12: Creating a class in Ruby", lang=ruby, linenos=off}
~~~~~~~
class Book
  def initialize(title)
    @title = title 
  end 
end
~~~~~~~

OK, also let's ensure we can link to something. 
It does NOT work to just type a URL inline, and it doesn't matter if it is on its own line.

Using non-standard brackets, ie no html a-ref. <http://leanpub.com> , works great.
Does a normal href work? <a 'here is title of a page link'> http://leanpub.com</a href>

Also there is an ability to give a title to the link : (This is the bc-leanpub repo)<https://github.com/AnneTheAgile/bc-leanpub>

Make this monospace; `We will see.`
OK that's enough.

USE REF=> Square/title + RoundParens/Pound-LABEL

Even here, should be able to reference those ID's. Curly, Pound, ID:
[link2 ruby code](#link2-ch01-ruby-code}
[link1 chapter header](#link1-chap1hdr)
[link3 my foo title, just a sentence ](#link3-foo-mytitle)
Done!

1A.Use the referenced info , eg footnote content later in the text, using the same tag, 
NOT with a \ colon and a space: 
rather use the 'usual' square-title round-pound-label.
This is Square-bracket, Pound, ID, [again foo-mytitle](#link3-foo-mytitle): This is the footnote content.
