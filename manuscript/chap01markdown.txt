# Chapter 1. Markdown flavors and Automation.

## Markdown at LeanPub.

It appears LeanPub uses a slightly non-standard markdown. I do not recall the original DaringFireball having its prefix items.

- Does it have G for generic box?
- Does it have Curly code? 

1.Make a Reference;  this[^01-foo], where Caret is required and Foo is a unique value BUT periods are Barred; 1A.Tell the referenced info , footnote content later in the text, using the same tag, with a \ colon and a space: 
[^01-foo]: This is the footnote content.

Here we will show a code block, aka  a recipe. and it has an id.

{#ch01-ex12-ruby-init}

{title="Example 12: Creating a class in Ruby", lang=ruby, linenos=off}
~~~~~~~
class Book
  def initialize(title)
    @title = title 
  end 
end
~~~~~~~

OK, also let's ensure we can link to something. 
It does NOT work to just type a URL inline, and it doesn't matter if it is on its own line.

http://leanpub.com

Using non-standard brackets, ie no html a-ref. <http://leanpub.com> , works great.
Also there is an ability to give a title to the link : (This is the bc-leanpub repo)<https://github.com/AnneTheAgile/bc-leanpub>

Make this monospace; `We will see.`
OK that's enough.
