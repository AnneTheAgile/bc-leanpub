# This is an Index with Header level 1, otherwise level 2 is not on another page.

We have these references; 

{#ch01-ex12-ruby-init}

Try that above with square not parens. 

{#ch01-ex12-ruby-init}

The other one was; {#01-foo}
Those above are using CURLY POUND ID, the proper way to reference. 

Now ending text.

[^01-foo] This is the footnote we had before.

Now on its own line.

[^01-foo]
